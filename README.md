# Heart Attack Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the risk of heart attack using various machine learning models. The dataset used contains several features such as age, sex, cholesterol level, and chest pain type. The project utilizes different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks to perform the prediction task.

## Technical Stack

### Libraries Used:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computing.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.
- **TensorFlow-Keras**: For building and training neural network models.

### Data Exploration:

The initial data exploration includes loading the dataset, understanding its structure, checking for missing values, and exploring descriptive statistics. Categorical and numerical features are identified. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed using visualizations to understand the distribution of variables and their relationships.

### Model Building and Evaluation:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A basic linear classification model is used.
2. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Employed for non-linear classification.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**: Utilized for ensemble learning.
4. **K Nearest Neighbors**: A simple instance-based learning algorithm.
5. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning model using TensorFlow-Keras.

Each model is trained, evaluated, and its accuracy score is computed. Confusion matrices are generated to assess the performance further. The project emphasizes visualizing the results to aid in understanding and comparison of different models.
